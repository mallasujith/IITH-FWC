# AVR-GCC
AVR-GCC is a special tool that helps programmers write software for a type of tiny computer called an AVR microcontroller. AVR-GCC takes the code <b>written in a programming language</b> like C or C++ and <b>turns it into a form </b>that the microcontroller can understand and run. <br>
<br>It's like a translator that helps developers communicate with and control these small electronic brains, allowing them to create various electronic devices and gadgets.
### Features of AVR-GCC:
<pre>
<b>1)Open Source and Free:</b>
    AVR-GCC is part of the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), which is open source and freely available. This makes it accessible to a wide range of developers and allows for collaboration and community support.

<b>2)Cross-Platform Support:</b>
    AVR-GCC is designed to be cross-platform, meaning it can run on different operating systems such as Windows, Linux, and macOS. This cross-platform support makes it versatile for developers using various environments.

<b>3)Standard Programming Languages:</b>
    AVR-GCC supports standard programming languages such as C and C++. This allows developers to leverage the power and expressiveness of these languages when writing firmware for AVR microcontrollers.

<b>4)Rich Feature Set:</b>
    AVR-GCC comes with a comprehensive set of features and optimizations for generating efficient code. It includes support for inline assembly, optimization levels, and various compiler flags that developers can use to fine-tune their code.

  <b>And Soo... On...</b>

### Working 
This contains file for avr gcc this is done on arduino droid directly by uploading the <b>.ino</b> file via otg to arduino.
